Hi I'm Will, a reverse engineer and C++ developer from the fabled lands of Australia. I work on projects relating to game reversing and occassionally dabble in reversing drivers and random things.

Some projects I've worked on include:
[ReNMS](https://github.com/VITALISED/renms)
[Northstar](https://github.com/R2Northstar)

Please get in touch via email, I always enjoy correspondance.
